# 🏨 Booking Scraper

This Python project uses **Selenium** and **Tkinter** to automatically extract hotel data from **Booking.com**. It features a graphical interface to define search parameters (destination, dates), then stores the result in an Excel file. Ideal for comparing hotels around an event location such as a wedding, festival, or conference.

## ✨ Features

- **User-friendly GUI** with `Tkinter`
- **Automated hotel data extraction**:
  - Hotel name
  - Star rating
  - Price
  - Review score
  - Booking.com link
  - Address and GPS coordinates
  - Distance from a fixed location
- **Distance calculation** using `geopy`
- **Excel export** with `pandas` and `openpyxl`

   ```

## 🧠 Technical Overview

### Main Functions:

* `extract_hotels(driver)`: Extracts the main hotel information from the Booking results page.
* `fetch_details(driver, hotel_link)`: Gathers additional details such as address, latitude, and longitude.
* `calculate_distance(hotel_coords, event_coords)`: Computes distance in kilometers between each hotel and a fixed reference point.
* `run_scraping(destination, checkin, checkout)`: Orchestrates the scraping process and writes to Excel.
* `on_submit()`: GUI callback triggered when the user clicks the scraping button.

### Distance Calculation Location:

By default, the distance is calculated from this fixed location:

```python
event_coords = (36.74196135173365, 15.11610252956532)
```

You can replace these coordinates with your own event location.
